# Streaming full-blueprint export tracker

**Updated:** 2026-10-25
**Overall status:** E failed pending qualification decision
**Current task:** E, streaming export qualification
**Next action:** Decide whether the 20 GiB target includes the checkpoint-phase working-set peak, then reduce that peak or approve a revised qualification boundary.
**Latest blocker:** The guarded 50,000-trajectory run preserved bytes/hash and export telemetry, but measured a 25,299,271,680-byte external process peak during checkpointing, above Task E's 20 GiB target.

## Tasks

| Task | Status | Result or blocker | Depends on | Task file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | Complete | Added the schema-2-compatible bounded writer, validator, hasher, and strict temporary publication path; focused and repository validation passed. | None | [Artifact streaming writer](A-artifact-streaming-writer.md) |
| B | Complete | Added direct ordered trainer emission with bounded scratch, exact planning, and export exclusion. | A | [Trainer streaming emission](B-trainer-streaming-emission.md) |
| C | Complete | Added fresh export process/system gates, separate telemetry, and versioned report serialization. | None | [Export memory gate and reporting](C-export-memory-gate-reporting.md) |
| D | Complete | Production workflow uses gated streaming publication with exact export and gate telemetry; boundary and preservation coverage passed. | A, B, C | [Workflow integration and publication](D-workflow-integration-publication.md) |
| E | Failed | Guarded 50,000-trajectory qualification preserved bytes/hash and stayed below the system ceiling, but the checkpoint-phase process peak exceeded the 20 GiB acceptance target. | D | [Qualification and release evidence](E-streaming-export-qualification.md) |

## Status values

- `Ready`: Dependencies are complete and work may begin.
- `In progress`: An agent is implementing or verifying the task.
- `Blocked`: A listed dependency, decision, or verified failure prevents work.
- `Complete`: Acceptance conditions and required validation passed.
- `Failed`: Work produced a verified failure requiring a new decision.

## Update rules

1. Before editing a task's production scope, mark it `In progress` and update the date, current task, next action, and blocker summary.
2. When blocked, record the exact unmet dependency or failure in the table.
3. Mark a task `Complete` only after its acceptance conditions and actual validation pass; link evidence in the task file and `docs/PLURIBUS_LOG.md`.
4. Mark newly unblocked tasks `Ready` in the same update.
5. Keep the table summary to one sentence. Keep details in its task file.
